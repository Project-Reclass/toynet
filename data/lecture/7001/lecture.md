## Why Learn Computer Networking?

I'm Tay, one of your instructors here at Project Reclass. On my right is Kunal. We founded Project Reclass together to make computer networking education more accessible.

You are probably here because someone has convinced you that a career in computer networking can make you lots of money, or you are looking for a new way to exercise your mind. Regardless of your personal reason for joining us on this learning adventure, we are here to take you step by step into the very cool world of computer networks! Networks allow digital content like books, scientific papers, birthday videos, or space images to travel across the world. It also keeps us safe by helpinng us alert others when there is a flood, fire, or other natural disasters. Networks allow families that are far apart to talk to each other. Computer networks send all this information in tiny tiny little packets that move across cables, satellites, and Wi-Fi like cars move around highways. By the end of this course, you will be an expert on the ins-and-outs of how it all works!

## How ToyNet is Structured

ToyNet is a comprehensive learning platform that provides lectures, hands-on labs, skill assessments, and publications on computer networking. Itâ€™s easy to get lost in the jargon, so we have broken down the material into small, easy segments. You are currently reading through a `Lecture` submodule in the larger introductory module called "Welcome to ToyNet!" Lectures can contain paragraphs and diagrams to explain new concepts to you, while `Animation` submodules provide you fully diagram explanations of the same material. If you learn best by listening, you may enjoy our guest lecturers from across industry who appear in the `Video` submodules. `Article`s will detail specific, real-life events that solidify your understanding of computer networking. Finally, if you like hands-on exercises, there are `Lab` submodules where you can try out the concepts you're learning about in a network empulator.

Be sure to fill out `Survey`s and `Quiz`zes along the way so we can learn ways to make our coursework clearer and help you assess where you stand with the new information. There will also be career modules sprinkled throughout the course to help you land your first computer networking job. While we recommend going through all of the content if you are serious about career in computer networking, it is not strictly necesary. If you read all of the lectures you'll have a pretty good idea of how things work even if you skip the other submodules!

We are very excited for you to join us. Click `Next >>` to see a video about how ToyNet was born!
