# The OSI Model

## Models

A **model** is a simplified representation of a real thing. Miniature carrier  replicas, weather maps, and architectural diagrams are examples of models we see in our daily lives. What other models can you think up?

The way we communicate through computers can also be represented by a simplified diagram, and in fact that is what this lesson is all about! Computer scientists, like other scientists, studied, designed, tried, and improved these over decades to create reliable communication across the globe. Without models, it would have been very challenging for them to agree on how to create and maintain the world wide web! Network engineers share a mental model of computer networking when creating or using tools so that people around the world can send and receive information in the same way.

There are two prevalent models used in industry to demonstrate how different networking technologies should work together: the **TCP/IP model** and the **seven-layer OSI model**. The TCP/IP model is a simplified view of the seven-layer OSI model. In this module, you will learn what each of different layers is responsible for and how information is passed from computer to computer through these abstractions using **network protocols**.

## Network Protocols

Protocols are sets of clearly defined rules, regulations, standards, and procedures that enable  people to perform some set of pre-established actions effectively. To explore what protocols are, letâ€™s go back to an example you may be familiar with: radios. 

A conversation on the radio might look like this:

```
1. BOBCAT, this is ALPINE, //////// static ////////, OVER.
2. ALPINE, this is BOBCAT, MESSAGE COMING IN BROKEN, OVER.
3. BOBCAT, this is ALPINE, RADIO CHECK, OVER.
4. ALPINE, this is BOBCAT, ROGER, OVER.
5. Deliver me the thumbdrive by 4pm, READBACK, OVER.
6. I READ BACK, Deliver me the thumbdrive by 4pm, OVER.
7. CORRECT, OVER
8. WILCO, OVER
9. ROGER, OUT
6. I READ BACK, Deliver me the thumbdrive by 4pm, OVER.
7. CORRECT, OVER
8. WILCO, OVER
9. ROGER, OUT
```

To hold this conversation successfully over the radio, both parties need to agree on what various words mean including their callsigns (`ALPINE` and `BOBCAT`) to remain anonymous. Alice and Bob also need to how to establish how to know when each party is done speaking because the radio can only communicate in one direction at a time. The only purpose of this transmission was for Alice to communicate to Bob that she needs a thumbdrive by 4pm. To understand this short transmission, Alice and Bob must both know the following transmission guidelines: 

- `OVER`: end a message expecting response
- `RADIO CHECK`: ask for clarity and volume of communication
- `ROGER`: confirm receipt of message
- `READ BACK`: ask recipient to repeat back the message exactly as received
- `I READ BACK`: repeating the instructions back to a sender to confirm content
- `CORRECT`: confirm the message broadcasted is correct
- `WILCO`: indicate understanding of & compliance with received instructions.
- `OUT`: end a transmission

Alice and Bob are using a radio protocol - a set of clearly defined rules, regulations, standards, and procedures that enable individuals communicating information over the radio.

Throughout this lesson, you will be exposed to internet protocols - sets of clearly defined rules, regulations, standards, and procedures that enable hardware & software developers to make devices & applications to communicate with each other.
