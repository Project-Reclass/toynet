# Why do we need Computer Networks?
Lecturer: Tay Nishimura

So you're here to learn computer networking... perhaps someone has convinced you that this career path can make you lots of money, or maybe you are bored out of your mind and just looking for something engaging to keep you busy. Regardless of your personal reason for joining us on this learning adventure, it will be helpful to remember the big picture of exactly why experts care enough about the topic to dedicate time and effort into learning this deep, complex topic.

I'm Tay, one of your instructors here at Project Reclass, and I want to convince you that computer networking matters... a lot! For example, networks allow digital content like literature, science, and space images to from nation to nation so that our children can absorb and build off of the limits of human knowledge today. It can also keep us safe allowing governing bodies such as the government, military, city, and the United Nations to keep in touch with each other real time in the face of natural disasters and other threats. Networks allow families that are far apart to talk to each other and share personal updates on social media or video calls. Networks do this by creating a way for technology such as cell phones, laptops, enterprise servers, and even laundry machines to send tiny piece of data to each other very quickly.

This submodule you are currently on is called `Lecture`s. This is our main form of communication with you. ToyNet will be sharing information with you in a variety of different ways (videos, animations, articles, etc). For a more concrete explanation of how computer networks can help us, check out the following `Animation` by clicking `Next Submodule`.
