## Why Learn Computer Networking?

I'm Tay, one of your instructors here at Project Reclass. On my right is Kunal. Together, we founded Project Reclass together to make computer networking education more accessible.

So let's get back to you... perhaps someone has convinced you that a career in computer networking can make you lots of money, or maybe you are bored out of your mind and just looking for something engaging to keep you busy. Regardless of your personal reason for joining us on this learning adventure, it will be helpful to remember the big picture of exactly why experts care enough about the topic to dedicate time and effort into learning this deep, complex topic. I am here to convince you that computer networking matters... a lot!

For example, networks allow digital content like literature, science, and space images to from nation to nation so that our children can absorb and build off of the limits of human knowledge today. It can also keep us safe allowing governing bodies such as the government, military, city, and the United Nations to keep in touch with each other real time in the face of natural disasters and other threats. Networks allow families that are far apart to talk to each other and share personal updates on social media or video calls. Networks do this by creating a way for technology such as cell phones, laptops, enterprise servers, and even laundry machines to send tiny piece of data to each other very quickly.

## How ToyNet is Structured

ToyNet is a comprehensive learning platform that provides lectures, hands-on labs, skill assessments, and publications on computer networking. Itâ€™s easy to get lost in the jargon associated with the computer networking. We present the complexity of the internet in small, easily digestible modules and submodules designed to support a variety of learning styles. This means you'll see or hear the same information in multiple ways, and some of those ways will likely be more helpful to you than others. That is normal!

The submodule you are currently on is called `Lecture`s which is primarily text with some diagrams. This is our main form of communication with you. For a more concrete explanation of how computer networks can help us, we have prepared the  `Animation` submodule which you'll see a sample of in a few submodules.

We invite guest lecturers from across industry in our `Video` submodules. You will see a couple videos in the module on why the history of ToyNet, including a recording of our volunteers who tells us why he served in the US Army and his experience transitioning into the civilian technology inudstry. For our practical learners, `Article`s will detail specific, real-life events involving computer networking.

If you enjoy learning through interaction, we have `Survey`s to get to know you a little better, and `Quiz`zes to help you assess how your learning is coming along. Our technology team also built an entire network emulator so you can practice fundamental system administration skills right inside of ToyNet! You'll see a demo of the emulator lab later in this module.

Now that you know what ToyNet is all about, we want to share who we originally built it for - click `Next >>` to see a video about the mission of Project Reclass!
